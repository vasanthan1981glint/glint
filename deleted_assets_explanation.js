// Check what videos in your Firebase are using deleted asset IDs
console.log('🔍 UNDERSTANDING THE DELETED ASSETS ISSUE');
console.log('========================================');

console.log('📋 WHAT HAPPENED:');
console.log('1. Videos were uploaded → Created Upload IDs & Asset IDs');
console.log('2. Something went wrong → Assets got errored status');  
console.log('3. You deleted the errored assets from Mux dashboard');
console.log('4. Upload IDs still exist but point to deleted assets');
console.log('5. App tries to stream deleted assets → NSURLErrorDomain -1008');

console.log('\n💡 THE REAL SOLUTION:');
console.log('=====================');
console.log('Those videos need to be RE-UPLOADED because:');
console.log('❌ Original assets are permanently deleted');
console.log('❌ Upload IDs cannot be reused');
console.log('❌ No way to recover deleted Mux assets');
console.log('✅ Fresh upload will create new working assets');

console.log('\n🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTION NEEDED:');
console.log('==========================');
console.log('1. Identify which videos are using deleted asset IDs');
console.log('2. Mark them for re-upload in your app');
console.log('3. Remove the broken video records from Firebase');
console.log('4. Users re-upload those specific videos');

console.log('\n🔧 PERMANENT FIX STATUS:');
console.log('========================');
console.log('✅ Conversion system works perfectly');
console.log('✅ Will prevent future Asset ID issues');
console.log('✅ Handles Upload ID → Playback ID correctly');
console.log('❌ Cannot fix already-deleted assets');
console.log('💡 Prevention system for future uploads');

console.log('\n📱 NEXT STEPS:');
console.log('==============');
console.log('1. Test upload a NEW video → should work perfectly');
console.log('2. Identify broken videos in Firebase'); 
console.log('3. Provide re-upload option to users');
console.log('4. Clean up deleted asset references');

console.log('\n🎉 You solved the mystery! The permanent fix prevents this in the future.');
