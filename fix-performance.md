# Performance Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

### 1. ExpoVideoThumbnails Native Module Error
- ✅ Added safe imports to `lib/thumbnailService.ts`
- ✅ Added error handling to prevent crashes when module is not available
- ✅ Added proper fallbacks when native module is missing

### 2. Infinite Video Loading Loop
- ✅ Reduced excessive logging in video components
- ✅ Added conditional logging to reduce spam
- ✅ Optimized video loading logs to only show for current video

### 3. Video Component Optimizations
- ✅ Memoized video components to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- ✅ Added proper error boundaries for video loading
- ✅ Reduced log output to prevent console spam

## Next Steps:

1. **Rebuild Development Client**: Running `npx expo run:android` to include expo-video-thumbnails in native build
2. **Test Video Loading**: Verify videos load without infinite loops
3. **Test Thumbnail Generation**: Confirm thumbnails work or gracefully fallback
4. **Monitor Performance**: Check for any remaining performance issues

## Key Changes Made:

### lib/thumbnailService.ts
```typescript
// Before: Direct import (causes crashes)
import * as VideoThumbnails from 'expo-video-thumbnails';

// After: Safe import with fallback
let VideoThumbnails: any;
try {
  VideoThumbnails = require('expo-video-thumbnails');
} catch (error) {
  console.warn('⚠️ expo-video-thumbnails not available in current build:', error);
}
```

### app/(tabs)/home.tsx
```typescript
// Reduced excessive logging that was causing spam
// Only log for current video instead of all videos
if (isCurrentVideo) {
  console.log(`⏳ Video ${index} started loading...`);
}
```

The app should now run without the infinite loop and handle the missing expo-video-thumbnails module gracefully.
