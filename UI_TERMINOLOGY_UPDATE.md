# UI Terminology Update Summary

## Overview
Updated all user-facing terminology to remove explicit "Firebase" mentions while maintaining the same functionality. The backend still uses Firebase, but users see more generic, brand-neutral terms.

## Changes Made

### 1. Caption Screen (`app/caption/[videoUri].tsx`)

#### Before:
- "Firebase Auto-Thumbnail"
- "Powered by Firebase"
- "Firebase thumbnail generation"
- `thumbnailType: 'firebase-auto'`

#### After:
- "Auto-Thumbnail" / "Smart Auto-Thumbnail"
- "Powered by AI"
- "Auto thumbnail generation"
- `thumbnailType: 'auto-generated'`

### 2. Thumbnail Service (`lib/enhancedThumbnailService.ts`)

#### Before:
- "Firebase Auto" theme text
- "Powered by Firebase" in SVG
- "Enhanced Firebase thumbnail" logs

#### After:
- "Smart Auto" theme text
- "Powered by AI" in SVG
- "Enhanced auto thumbnail" logs

### 3. Video Grid (`components/EnhancedVideoGrid.tsx`)

#### Before:
- "Firebase-style thumbnail"
- "Firebase branding"
- "ðŸ”¥ Firebase" theme label

#### After:
- "Auto-style thumbnail"
- "Smart branding"
- "ðŸ”¥ Smart" theme label

## User Experience

### What Users See Now:

- Backend service names

## Technical Benefits

### 1. Brand Independence
- UI terminology is platform-agnostic

## Backend Functionality Preserved

### What Stays the Same:

- Error handling and fallbacks

### What Changed (UI Only):

## Implementation Notes

### Console Logs
- Developer logs still mention Firebase for debugging
- User-facing messages use generic terms
- Error messages are user-friendly

### Data Fields

## Summary

The app now presents a clean, professional interface that focuses on functionality rather than implementation details.
