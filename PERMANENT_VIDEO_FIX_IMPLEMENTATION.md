# Permanent Video Playback Fix Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive solution implemented to permanently fix NSURLErrorDomain -1008 video playback errors by ensuring only valid Mux Playback IDs are used for streaming.

## Root Cause

The -1008 errors were caused by using Upload IDs or Asset IDs in playback URLs instead of proper Mux Playback IDs:
- Upload IDs (e.g., `H00rUEZPwkFVPE8YrrTF02Uc02rVHzD5cgZnINyyi6t01400`)
- Asset IDs (e.g., `vhQbcuFkjZEDWxL...`)
- Instead of Playback IDs (e.g., `ym4C8vM7mJ4JxJWFy00yejH0102Q9qphPN02uuttsl202lvQ`)

## Implementation Changes

### 1. Frontend Upload Flow Fix (`app/(tabs)/me.tsx`)

**Problem**: Frontend was incorrectly saving Upload IDs as `playbackId` and `playbackUrl` fields.

**Solution**: 
- Store Upload ID separately in `uploadId` field
- Set `playbackId` and `playbackUrl` to `null` initially
- Mark videos as `processed: false, status: 'uploading'` until webhook confirms readiness
- Only store real Asset IDs when available from Mux

```typescript
// Before (WRONG)
const playbackId = finalAssetId; // Could be Upload ID!
playbackUrl: `https://stream.mux.com/${playbackId}.m3u8`

// After (CORRECT)
uploadId: uploadId, // Store Upload ID separately
playbackId: null, // Will be set only after Mux asset is ready
playbackUrl: null, // Will be set only after we have real Playback ID
processed: false, // Not processed until Mux confirms
status: 'uploading' // Will be 'ready' only after webhook
```

### 2. Player Protection (`components/VerticalVideoPlayer.tsx`)

**Problem**: Player would attempt to play videos with Upload/Asset IDs, causing -1008 errors.

**Solution**: Added strict blocking for bad URLs with conversion and fallback states:

```typescript
// Detect bad URLs
const hasUploadId = isUploadIdUrl(videoUrl);
const hasAssetId = isAssetIdUrl(videoUrl);

if (hasUploadId || hasAssetId) {
  // Try sync fix first
  const syncFixed = fixVideoUrlSync(videoUrl);
  if (syncFixed !== videoUrl) {
    videoUrl = syncFixed; // Use cached mapping
  } else {
    // Block playback, show "preparing video" state
    shouldBlockPlayback = true;
    // Start async conversion...
  }
}
```

**New States Added**:
- `videosNeedingConversion`: Tracks videos requiring URL conversion
- `conversionInProgress`: Shows loading state during conversion
- Preparing video UI with loading indicator

### 3. Backend Webhook Enhancement (`backend/server.js`)

**Problem**: No mechanism to update Firestore when Mux assets become ready.

**Solution**: Enhanced webhook to properly update video documents:

```javascript
async function handleAssetReady(assetData) {
  // Get asset details from Mux
  const asset = await mux.video.assets.retrieve(assetId);
  const playbackId = asset.playback_ids.find(p => p.policy === 'public').id;
  
  // Update Firestore with REAL playback data
  const updates = {
    assetId: assetId,
    playbackId: playbackId, // REAL Playback ID
    playbackUrl: `https://stream.mux.com/${playbackId}.m3u8`,
    thumbnailUrl: `https://image.mux.com/${playbackId}/thumbnail.jpg`,
    processed: true,
    status: 'ready'
  };
}
```

### 4. Emergency Fix Cache (Existing)

Pre-cached mappings for known problematic Upload IDs:
```typescript
const UPLOAD_TO_PLAYBACK_MAP = {
  'H00rUEZPwkFVPE8YrrTF02Uc02rVHzD5cgZnINyyi6t01400': 'ym4C8vM7mJ4JxJWFy00yejH0102Q9qphPN02uuttsl202lvQ',
  'i5W00Mt00xSWd102G1oarUdLeEnzXhHe1o7LanMti9pa3A': 'exI02CGE00pZ8UZTV54w22afKhOj75xLLkA1njkM8eapA'
};
```

## Flow Diagram

### New Upload Flow
```
1. User uploads video
2. Frontend creates Upload ID, stores it in uploadId field
3. Sets playbackId/playbackUrl to null, status: 'uploading'
4. Mux processes video â†’ webhook fires when ready
5. Webhook gets real Playback ID, updates Firestore
6. Player loads with correct Playback ID â†’ no -1008 errors
```

### Legacy Video Handling
```
1. Player detects Upload/Asset ID in URL
2. Checks emergency cache for immediate fix
3. If found: uses cached Playback ID instantly
4. If not found: shows "preparing video", starts async conversion
5. If conversion fails: shows "video needs re-upload"
```

## Error Prevention

### Backend Guards
- Never save Upload/Asset IDs as `playbackId`
- Only mark `status: 'ready'` after Mux webhook confirms asset readiness
- Store real Playback IDs only after retrieving from Mux API

### Frontend Guards  
- Block autoplay for videos with Upload/Asset IDs until conversion
- Show loading state during conversion attempts
- Prefer converted URLs from state over original URLs
- Immediate sync fixes for known mappings

### Player Guards
- Detect Asset ID URLs and warn in console
- Use `videoSources` state to override bad URLs
- Never attempt playback without valid Playback ID

## Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: New Upload
âœ… **Expected**: Upload ID stored separately, playbackId/playbackUrl null until webhook

### Scenario 2: Legacy Video with Cached Mapping
âœ… **Expected**: Immediate sync fix, plays without error

### Scenario 3: Legacy Video without Mapping
âœ… **Expected**: Shows "preparing video", attempts async conversion

### Scenario 4: Failed/Deleted Asset
âœ… **Expected**: Shows "video needs re-upload" after conversion fails

## Verification Commands

To verify the fix is working:

```bash
# Check for Upload IDs in playback URLs (should be 0)
grep -r "H00r\|i5W00M\|gihGTEI" firestore_exports/

# Check player logs for Asset ID warnings
# Should see: "SYNC FIX SUCCESS" or "BLOCKING PLAYBACK"

# Verify webhook updates in backend logs
# Should see: "Updated Firestore document with playback ID"
```

## Impact

- **Eliminates -1008 errors** by preventing Upload/Asset IDs in playback URLs
- **Backward compatible** with legacy videos via emergency cache
- **Self-healing** for future uploads via proper webhook handling
- **User-friendly** with loading states for problematic videos
- **Diagnostic-rich** with detailed logging for debugging

## Next Steps

1. Monitor logs for any remaining -1008 errors
2. Add more Upload ID mappings to emergency cache as discovered
3. Consider cleanup script for legacy Firestore documents
4. Set up Mux webhook in production environment
