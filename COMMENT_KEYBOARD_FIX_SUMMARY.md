# Comment System Keyboard & UI Fixes - Complete

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Keyboard Hiding Input Bar
**Problem**: Type bar was hiding under the keyboard when replying
**Solution**: 
- Anchored input bar absolutely above keyboard using `keyboardHeight`
- Removed KeyboardAvoidingView double-shifting behavior
- Added proper bottom positioning: `bottom: keyboardHeight + safeArea`

### 2. ✅ Extra Spacing Between Input and Keyboard
**Problem**: Large gap between input bar and keyboard
**Solution**:
- Reduced CommentBox padding from 12-20px to 8px
- Minimized container height and spacing
- Set input bar `minHeight: 60` instead of 80-120

### 3. ✅ User Profiles Not Displaying
**Problem**: Comment usernames showing as "Anonymous" and generic avatars
**Solution**:
- Fixed userProfile fallbacks: `currentUserProfile?.username || 'You'`
- Improved avatar generation with better colors: `background=4ECDC4&color=ffffff`
- Added logging for avatar load success/failure

### 4. ✅ Comment Likes Not Saving
**Problem**: Likes not persisting, no visual feedback
**Solution**:
- Enhanced `toggleCommentLike` integration with Firebase
- Added optimistic UI updates for instant feedback
- Included proper error handling and revert logic

### 5. ✅ Universal User Support
**Problem**: System only worked for authenticated users
**Solution**:
- Created fallback user IDs: `user_${Date.now()}`
- Enhanced anonymous user support with unique identifiers
- Improved profile handling for all user types
