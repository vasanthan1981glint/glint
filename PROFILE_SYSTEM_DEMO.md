# ðŸŽ‰ Enhanced Profile System - Complete Implementation

## âœ¨ What's New

Your profile system has been completely enhanced with social media-style features! Here's what's been implemented:

### ðŸ”„ Dynamic Profile Views
- **Own Profile**: Shows upload buttons, edit profile, settings - everything you can control
- **Other Users' Profiles**: Shows follow/unfollow buttons, message button, and profile stats

### ðŸ“Š Social Media Style Counts
- **1K, 2K, 1M format**: Follower/following counts now display like Instagram/TikTok
  - 999 â†’ "999"
  - 1,000 â†’ "1K" 
  - 1,200 â†’ "1.2K"
  - 1,000,000 â†’ "1M"

### ðŸ‘¥ Follow System
- **Follow/Unfollow**: Real-time follow functionality with Firebase backend
- **Live Count Updates**: Follower counts update immediately when someone follows/unfollows
- **Follow Status**: Button shows "Follow" or "Following" based on current relationship

### ðŸŽ¬ Accurate Video Counts
- **Real Glint Counts**: Shows actual number of videos uploaded by the user
- **Dynamic Updates**: Count increases when new videos are uploaded
- **User-Specific**: Each profile shows only that user's videos

## ðŸš€ How to Use

### Viewing Your Own Profile
1. Open the Me tab - you'll see:
   - Upload button (+) in top right
   - Settings button (â‹¯) 
   - "Edit Profile" button
   - Your videos in the Glints tab

### Viewing Another User's Profile
1. Navigate to another user's profile with `userId` parameter
2. You'll see:
   - No upload or settings buttons
   - "Follow"/"Following" button instead of "Edit Profile"
   - "Message" button
   - Their videos and accurate follower counts

### Example Navigation
```typescript
// Navigate to view someone else's profile
router.push('/me?userId=OTHER_USER_ID');

// Navigate back to your own profile  
router.push('/me');
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Key Features Added:

1. **Smart Profile Detection**
```typescript
const viewingUserId = params.userId as string;
const isOwnProfile = !viewingUserId || viewingUserId === auth.currentUser?.uid;
```

2. **Number Formatting Function**
```typescript
const formatCount = (count: number): string => {
  if (count >= 1000000) {
    return (count / 1000000).toFixed(1).replace('.0', '') + 'M';
  } else if (count >= 1000) {
    return (count / 1000).toFixed(1).replace('.0', '') + 'K';
  }
  return count.toString();
};
```

3. **Follow System**
```typescript
const handleFollowToggle = async () => {
  // Updates both follower/following counts in real-time
  // Creates/deletes follow relationship in Firebase
  // Updates UI immediately for better UX
};
```

4. **Video Grid Integration**
```typescript
<EnhancedVideoGrid 
  userId={profileUserId} // Shows specific user's videos
  refreshTrigger={videoRefreshTrigger}
/>
```

## ðŸ“± UI Components

### Follow Buttons
- **Follow Button**: Blue background, white text
- **Following Button**: Gray background, black text  
- **Message Button**: Outlined style for secondary action

### Upload Controls
- Only visible on your own profile
- Hidden completely when viewing others' profiles
- Upload modals only appear for profile owner

### Stats Display
- Consistent formatting across all profiles
- Real-time updates when relationships change
- Accurate video counts from Firebase

## ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Usage

This system now works exactly like modern social media apps:

1. **Instagram-style**: Follow/unfollow with live counts
2. **TikTok-style**: Formatted numbers (1K, 2M, etc.)
3. **YouTube-style**: Accurate video counts per creator
4. **Universal**: Works for any user viewing any profile

Your users can now:
- âœ… Follow and unfollow each other
- âœ… See accurate, formatted follower counts  
- âœ… View other users' video collections
- âœ… Upload their own content (only on their profile)
- âœ… Navigate between profiles seamlessly

The system automatically handles authentication, permissions, and data consistency across all interactions!
