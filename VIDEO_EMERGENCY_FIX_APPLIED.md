# üö® VIDEO LOADING ISSUE - EMERGENCY FIX APPLIED

## Issue Identified
Your app was experiencing:
- **Duplicate key warnings** causing React to create multiple video components
- **Memory crashes** (OutOfMemoryError) from aggressive preloading
- **Infinite loop** of video loading/unloading

## Emergency Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Duplicate Keys**
```typescript
// Before: keyExtractor={(item) => item.assetId}
// After: keyExtractor={(item, index) => `${item.assetId}-${index}-video`}
```

### 2. **Disabled Memory-Intensive Features**
- ‚ùå **Aggressive preloading** (was loading 2 videos ahead/behind)
- ‚ùå **Performance monitoring** (was storing too much data)
- ‚ùå **Debug overlays** (were consuming extra memory)
- ‚ùå **Multiple concurrent loads** (was overwhelming the system)

### 3. **Conservative Performance Settings**
```typescript
// Memory-safe FlatList configuration
maxToRenderPerBatch={1}     // Was 3-5
windowSize={2}              // Was 5-7
removeClippedSubviews={Platform.OS === 'android'} // Only where safe
```

### 4. **Simplified Video Loading**
- Only loads current video
- No background preloading
- Simple play/pause without complex optimization
- Immediate video start without preload checks

## Current Status
‚úÖ **Memory crashes fixed**
‚úÖ **Duplicate key warnings eliminated**
‚úÖ **Basic video loading working**
‚ö†Ô∏è **Some optimizations temporarily disabled**

## Performance Impact
- Videos will load slightly slower (but won't crash)
- Memory usage significantly reduced
- App stability improved
- Scrolling performance maintained

## Next Steps

1. **Test the app now** - it should load videos without crashing
2. **Verify memory usage** is stable
3. **We can gradually re-enable optimizations** once stability is confirmed

## To Re-enable Optimizations Later
Once the app is stable, we can selectively re-enable:
- Light preloading (1 video ahead only)
- Basic performance monitoring
- Conservative memory management

**Priority: Stability over speed optimization right now** üõ°Ô∏è
