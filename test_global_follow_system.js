/**
 * Global Follow System Test
 * 
 * This test verifies that the follow state synchronization works across:
 * - Profile screen (app/profile/[userId].tsx)
 * - Vertical Video Player (components/VerticalVideoPlayer.tsx)
 * - Home feed (app/(tabs)/home.tsx)
 * 
 * Expected behavior:
 * 1. Following a user from any component should update the follow state globally
 * 2. Follow state should be synchronized across all components instantly
 * 3. Follow counts should update appropriately
 * 4. The global store should persist follow states and prevent unnecessary re-fetches
