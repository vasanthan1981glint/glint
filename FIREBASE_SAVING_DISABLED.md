# 🚫 Firebase Video Saving DISABLED

## ✅ Changes Made to Disable Firebase Saving

### 1. **Main Upload Function** (`uploadVideoWithEnhancedProgress`)
- ❌ **Firestore video saving** - Commented out `setDoc(db, 'videos', ...)` 
- ❌ **Firestore post saving** - Commented out `setDoc(db, 'posts', ...)`
- ❌ **User stats updates** - Commented out `updateDoc` for glint count
- ❌ **Video grid refresh** - Disabled since no videos are saved to database

### 2. **Background Upload Service**
- ❌ **Background upload calls** - Commented out `backgroundUploadService.startBackgroundUpload()`
- ❌ **Background upload listeners** - Disabled event listeners and progress tracking

### 3. **What Still Works:**
- ✅ **Video file upload** - Videos still upload to Firebase Storage
- ✅ **Thumbnail generation** - Thumbnails still generate and upload to Firebase Storage  
- ✅ **User interface** - Upload progress modal and UI still work
- ✅ **Authentication** - User authentication still works

### 4. **What's Disabled:**
- 🚫 Videos won't appear in the app's video feed
- 🚫 Videos won't be saved to Firestore database
- 🚫 No post records created for social features
- 🚫 User video counts won't update
- 🚫 Background upload system disabled

## 🎯 Result

Now when users upload videos:
1. ✅ Video file uploads to Firebase Storage
2. ✅ Thumbnail uploads to Firebase Storage  
3. ✅ User sees success message
4. 🚫 **But video is NOT saved to database**
5. 🚫 **Video won't appear in feeds or profiles**

## 🔄 To Re-enable Firebase Saving

1. Uncomment the code blocks marked with `/* ... */`
2. Remove the "DISABLED" log messages
3. Restore the original upload success messages

The video files and thumbnails will still exist in Firebase Storage, but won't be accessible through the app since they're not in the database.
