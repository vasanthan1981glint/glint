# Upload Testing Guide

## Test the Upload Behavior

### 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

1. **Test Glints Upload:**
   - Go to your profile
   - Click on "Glints" tab
   - Click the upload button (+)
   - Record/select a video
   - Add a caption like "Test Glints Video"
   - Upload
   - **Expected Result:** Video should appear in your Glints tab (grid layout)

2. **Test Trends Upload:**
   - Go to your profile  
   - Click on "Trends" tab
   - Click the upload button (+)
   - Record/select a video
   - Add a caption like "Test Trends Video"
   - Upload
   - **Expected Result:** 
     - Video should NOT appear in your Glints tab
     - Video should appear in the Trends tab (list layout)

### 🔍 **Debug Information to Watch:**

Check the console logs for these messages:

**During Upload:**
- `📤 Upload Context:` - Should show correct activeTab
- `💾 Video Document:` - Should show correct uploadTab
- `🔥 Video uploaded to Trends` or `💎 Video uploaded to Glints`

**During Grid Loading:**
- `🎯 Content filter:` - Should show "glint" for Glints tab
- `🚫 FILTERED OUT:` - Should show Trends videos being excluded from Glints
- `✅ INCLUDED:` - Should show which videos are included

### 🐛 **If Still Not Working:**

If Trends videos still appear in Glints:

1. Check the console logs to see the upload context
2. Verify the uploadTab field is being set correctly
3. Check if the filtering is working in EnhancedVideoGrid
4. Try switching between tabs after upload to trigger refresh

### 📱 **Expected Final Behavior:**

- **Glints Tab:** Grid of your personal videos (excluding Trends uploads)
- **Trends Tab:** YouTube-style list of trending videos (including your Trends uploads)
- **Upload Context:** Videos go to the correct tab based on where you initiated upload
