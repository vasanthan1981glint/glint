# Tab Behavior After Fix

## How the tabs now work:

### ðŸŽ¬ **Glints Tab**
- **What it shows**: User's personal videos in a grid layout (Instagram-style)
- **Content**: Videos uploaded normally OR uploaded to Glints tab
- **Excludes**: Videos that were uploaded specifically to Trends tab
- **Layout**: Grid of video thumbnails (3 columns)

### ðŸ”¥ **Trends Tab** 
- **What it shows**: YouTube-style trending feed with ALL trending content
- **Content**: 
  - Videos uploaded specifically to Trends tab (prioritized at top)
  - Other popular videos from all users
- **Layout**: List format with large thumbnails, titles, usernames, views, and time
- **Special features**: 
  - Shows "Trending" badge for videos uploaded to Trends
  - Shows view counts and time ago
  - Clicking opens full-screen video player

### ðŸ’¾ **Saved Tab**
- **What it shows**: Videos the user has saved
- **Layout**: Grid format similar to Glints

## Upload Behavior:

### When uploading from Glints tab:
- Video appears in user's **Glints** tab only
- Does NOT appear in Trends feed

### When uploading from Trends tab:
- Video appears in the global **Trends** feed (visible to all users)
- Does NOT appear in user's Glints tab
- Gets prioritized in the Trends feed
- Shows "Trending" badge in the feed

## The Fix:
- Before: Videos uploaded to Trends were showing in Glints
- After: Each tab shows the correct content type
- Trends tab now shows the YouTube-style feed you wanted (like in the image)
